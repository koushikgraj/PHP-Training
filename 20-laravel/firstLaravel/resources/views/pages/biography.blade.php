   <b>SHRIJI LIFESTYLE</b><br><br>
Shriji is very disciplined and lives a very simple life full of Seva. Shriji strictly follows daily chores without any miss or gap. Shriji says the first thought of morning makes your day complete, so the moment you wake up, first thank GOD and pray for everyoneâ€™s health, peace and happiness. Day of Shriji initiates by awakening at Brahma Muhurta, then she practices various spiritual activities like Dhyana, Japa, Asana, Pranayama, Pratah Bhraman(morning walk), Suryopasana, etc. followed by worshiping and feeding Gaumata (Mother Cow), feeding grains to birds. It is advised by Shriji that these activities must be practiced daily by everyone to stay fit and energetic. As it is said that a sound mind resides in a healthy body, so one should eat Sattvic food to remain healthy and listen to Satsang daily to keep the mind elevated. Shriji thus provides inspirational discourses and insists on listening to it daily that will help one to grow in all areas of life be it spiritual, physical, mental or emotional.
