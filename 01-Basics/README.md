# PHP Basics
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:
The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

##Variables:
In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
As other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


In the example, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.
PHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. 

##Functions:
The real power of PHP comes from its functions.
PHP has more than 1000 built-in functions, and in addition you can create your own custom functions.
Besides the built-in PHP functions, it is possible to create your own functions.
- A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.
- A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.
- A function will be executed by a call to the function.
